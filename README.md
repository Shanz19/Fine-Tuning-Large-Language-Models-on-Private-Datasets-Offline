## Introduction of the Industry

The NLP and machine learning field has boomed recently thanks to tech advances and big data. NLP lets computers understand human language, with applications in healthcare, finance, and more. Models like BERT and GPT are game-changers, excelling in tasks like text classification and translation. The merging of NLP with privacy and data security is crucial in today's digital era. Companies use NLP to gain insights and improve customer experiences, but demand for tailored solutions and data protection is rising. This report delves into methods for fine-tuning large language models on private datasets while safeguarding privacy and security.

## Why Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning adjusts pre-trained models to be more proficient in specific tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, or text summarization. This process improves model accuracy and effectiveness in specific domains, such as legal, medical, or technical fields. For example, fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) like GPT for question answering can significantly enhance its performance in that task. Fine-tuning typically involves training the model on a task-specific dataset, helping it learn to retrieve and formulate appropriate answers.

## BitsandBytes

To reduce memory requirements on costly GPU hardware, 16-bit, 8-bit, or 4-bit training is used. This method reduces memory cost compared to traditional 32-bit or 64-bit precision, making it feasible to fit the entire model into one GPU. Training or inference with the base model in 8-bit or 4-bit precision is achieved using PEFT and bitsandbytes. This reduces memory cost but is slower than 16-bit training on current architectures.

## Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

PEFT overcomes the problems of consumer hardware and storage costs by fine-tuning only a small subset of the model's parameters, significantly reducing computational expenses while freezing the weights of the original pre-trained LLM. This approach prevents catastrophic forgetting and reduces storage requirements to just a few MBs for each downstream dataset.

## LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models)

LoRA is a fine-tuning technique that introduces trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the transformer architecture. This reduces trainable parameters for downstream tasks while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen. LoRA can minimize the number of trainable parameters by up to 10,000 times and GPU memory necessity by 3 times, while still performing on par or better than full fine-tuning models on various tasks.

## QLoRA

QLoRA extends LoRA by quantizing weight parameters in the pre-trained LLM to 4-bit precision. This significantly reduces the memory footprint, making it possible to fine-tune the model on a single GPU, thus democratizing LLM fine-tuning to consumer GPUs.

## Data Preparation

To fine-tune a model, structured data in a question-and-answer format is required. This involves creating input/output pairs, prompt engineering, data pre-processing, and data filtering. The dataset is then converted into a JSONL format using the Llama-3-70B-Instruct gguf model.
**{
"input": "Who are you?", â€œoutput": "I am a Finetuned Chatbot.", 
}**
- In addition to creating input/output pairs, several other things have to be taken care of: 
Prompt engineering (e.,g., injection of <human>: and <bot>: into the text to indicate 
input/outputs). 
- Data pre-processing (e.g., removing incomplete sentences, too long dialogues). 
- Data filtering (e.g., removing profanity or undesired responses that are too short or 
low quality). 

## Foundation LLM Model

## Mistral-8x7B

Mistral 7B outperforms Llama 2 13B across all benchmark tests and rivals Llama 1 34B in many. It employs Grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference and Sliding Window Attention (SWA) for handling longer sequences with reduced computational costs. Mistral 7B is designed for effortless fine-tuning and shines in various tasks, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of NLP applications.
